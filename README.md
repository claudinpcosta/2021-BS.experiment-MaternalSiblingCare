# 2021-BS.experiment-MaternalSiblingCare

## Contains all analyses performed on datasets for brood care manipulation in bumble bee queens [(Costa et al. 2021)](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-021-01756-2)

### Synopsis

We performed an experiment to determine how maternal and sibling brood care differentially impact the developmental fate of workers in the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, using the maternal manipulation hypothesis as a guiding framework.
