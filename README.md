# 2021-BS.experiment-MaternalSiblingCare

## Contains all analyses performed on datasets for brood care manipulation in bumble bee queens [(Costa et al. 2021)](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-021-01756-2)

### Synopsis

We examined the body sizes of bumble bees in a large, recently burned forest-meadow complex, specifically in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, with the goal of understanding whether and how habitat type mediates the impact of fire on bee size, whether the habitat type in which it occurs (forest versus meadow)â€¦ We detected evidence that bees are larger in recently burned areas, irrespective of habitat type.
